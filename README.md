In 2017, the number of orders starts at the lowest point on the chart. There's a significant increase in 2018, reaching the peak on the chart, which suggests that 2018 had the highest number of orders. Then there's a decrease in 2019, dropping to a level that's still higher than 2017 but lower than 2018.

The chart illustrates the total cost associated with each order type. Here are the details:  Retail: The total cost for retail orders is approximately 782,420.78 USD. Wholesale: The total cost for wholesale orders is significantly higher at approximately 6,116,815.57 USD. This bar chart visually represents these totals, showing that the wholesale orders contribute a much larger amount to the total sales cost compared to retail. This could be due to a variety of factors, such as the number of items ordered, the price of items typically ordered in wholesale, or the frequency of wholesale orders. It would be interesting to analyze further to understand why wholesale is so dominant in terms of total cost and what strategies might be employed to either boost retail sales or optimize the profitability of wholesale.

The pie chart represents the distribution of orders between Retail and Wholesale order types. Here's the detailed information:  Retail: There were 2,143 retail orders. Wholesale: There were 2,833 wholesale orders. The pie chart visually conveys that the number of wholesale orders is slightly higher than retail. Although wholesale orders have a larger share in terms of order count, this does not necessarily correlate with revenue without additional context such as average order value or profit margins for each type.
